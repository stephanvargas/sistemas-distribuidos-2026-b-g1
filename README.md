## 2. My individual contribution
- Wrote the product brief (`prd.md`) for PRJ-FERRETERIA-V13: initial context, needs and problems, current process, open questions and business glossary (income, expense, net balance, daily cut, period, category).
- Fixed the declared stack and its boundaries: Angular frontend, Go backend, MySQL database. Explicitly scoped the product **out** of POS, invoicing, per-product inventory and ERP - the deliverable is aggregated financial control only.
- Derived the first backlog (HU-FIN-001 .. HU-FIN-005) from the "needs and problems" section, so every story traces back to a stated business need instead of a technical guess.
- Applied the Week-2 session material (see the summary below): drafted the **context map first** - a single `Finance` bounded context owning movements, categories and period summaries - before proposing any service boundary.
- Started **ADR-001 (architectural style)**: context = one administrator, low transaction volume, daily/weekly/monthly aggregate queries; decision = modular monolith in Go with a REST contract for Angular; alternatives rejected = microservices (no real scale or deploy need) and event-driven (no asynchronous integration in scope); consequences = simpler operation now, one extraction point later if reporting grows.
- Applied the microservice extraction rule from the session (real boundary **+** real scale/deploy need). Neither condition holds today, so the decision is documented as "well-designed modular monolith" rather than a distributed monolith with a shared database.
- Sketched the hexagonal layering for the Go side: `domain` (Movement, Category, Period, net-balance calculation) with no I/O, `application` (use cases), `infrastructure` (MySQL repository, HTTP handlers).

## 3. Blockers and risks
- **Open questions in the brief are still unanswered** and they block acceptance criteria: initial category catalogue, single vs. multiple users, whether a daily cut locks later edits, whether movements can be edited/voided, CSV/PDF export, and whether the net balance is per period only or also cumulative.
- The edit/void and daily-cut answers change the domain model directly (immutable ledger + reversal entries vs. mutable rows), so HU-FIN-001 and HU-FIN-002 cannot be closed until that is decided.
- Security level for system access is undefined; without it I cannot size the authentication story or decide if it belongs to Corte 1.
- No environment branches (`develop`, `qa`) exist in the repository yet, so the per-environment HU branch + PR flow could not be exercised this week - only `main` is present.
- Risk of scope creep towards a POS: the brief rules it out, and every new story must be checked against that boundary before it enters the backlog.

## 4. Plan for next week
- Close the open questions with the stakeholder and convert each answer into an acceptance criterion.
- Publish `ADR-001` as a file in the repository (Context / Decision / Alternatives / Consequences) following the session template.
- Create `develop` and `qa`, then open `hu-fin-001-dev` and `hu-fin-002-dev` with PRs to `develop`.
- Implement the `Movement` and `Category` domain in Go with unit tests for the net-balance calculation, keeping the domain free of I/O.
- Define the MySQL schema (movements, categories) and the REST contract consumed by Angular.
- Build the period-summary endpoint (day/week/month) plus an integration test against MySQL.

## 5. Compliance self-check
- [x] Conventional Commits - `type(scope): summary`
- [ ] Per-environment HU branch + PR to that environment (hu-xxx-dev -> develop, ...)
- [ ] Testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tests added/updated (unit / integration)
- [ ] DDD / hexagonal boundaries respected (domain has no I/O)
- [x] No secrets; config via environment variables

Notes on the unchecked items:
- Only `main` exists so far, so no HU branch or PR to `develop` could be opened.
- Acceptance criteria stay draft until the open questions in section 3 are answered.
- No production code was written this week, so there is nothing to test yet.
- The hexagonal layering is designed but not yet materialised in code.

Key principle taken from the material: **split for a reason, not for fashion** - a good architecture makes boundaries, contracts, trade-offs and the motive of the decision explicit.
